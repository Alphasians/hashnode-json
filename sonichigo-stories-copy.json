Since it's initial release in June 2014, the Kubernetes as a term, has been associated with words like k8s, k9s and very recently with k3s as well.</p>\n<p>But before we get started and deep dive into more about - k9s &amp; k3s, let's first get us familiarize ourselves with Kubernetes, shall we?</p>\n<p>So, the first thing that comes in mind is ~ <em>What is kubernetes?</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-what-is-kubernetes\">What is Kubernetes?</h1>\n<p>Kubernetes is a standard container orchestration open-source platform, that is, for managing applications constructed from several, often self-contained runtimes called containers. It is a widely used tool to deploy and update the application without any downtime.</p>\n<p>It is generally known as k8s or “kube”, where 8 in 'k8s' is a abbreviation for \"ubernete\".<br />Kubernetes also handles things like upgrades of your containers, so when you make a new release of your website, it will gradually launch containers with the new version and gradually kill off the old ones, usually over a minute or two.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-how-it-helps-us\">How it helps us?</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes orchestration allows you to build application services that span multiple containers, schedule those containers across a cluster, scale those containers, and manage the health of those containers over time. With Kubernetes you can take effective steps toward better IT security.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes also needs to integrate with networking, storage, security, telemetry, and other services to provide a comprehensive container infrastructure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656312811622/kldSdyrjG.png\" alt=\"image.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Microservices in containers make it** easier to orchestrate services**, including storage, networking, and security. This significantly multiplies the number of containers in your environment, and as those containers accumulate, the complexity also grows.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It fixes a lot of common problems with container proliferation by sorting containers together into \"pods.\" Pods <strong>add a layer of abstraction</strong> to grouped containers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Other parts of Kubernetes help you** balance loads** across these pods and ensure you have the right number of containers running to support your workloads.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-what-is-kubernetes-cluster\">What is Kubernetes-Cluster?</h2>\n<p>A working Kubernetes deployment is called a cluster. You can visualize a Kubernetes cluster as two parts: <strong>Master and Node</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Node</strong>: Where we run our applications</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Master</strong>: Used to coordinate the cluster.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each node is its own Linux environment, and which could be either a physical or virtual machine and each node runs pods, which are made up of containers.</p>\n<p>Master is responsible for managing the cluster. The master nodes will coordinate all the activities in your cluster, such as scheduling applications, maintaining their desired state, scaling applications, and rolling new updates.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656313435775/s5y0nfdyo.png\" alt=\"image.png\" /></p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-starting-with-k9s\">Starting with K9s</h1>\n<p><strong>k9s</strong> is a terminal-based UI for managing the Kubernetes clusters, that aims to simplify navigating, observing, and managing applications in k8s. K9s continuously monitors Kubernetes clusters for changes and provides shortcut commands to interact with the observed resources.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-installation\">Installation</h2>\n<p>K9s is open-source software and available for various operating systems with instructions on this official repository. If you use a package manager, K9s will be available through it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>On Mac OS, you can install K9s with brew: brew install k9s</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>On Windows, either via <em>scoop</em> or <em>chocolatey</em>: scoop install k9s choco install k9s</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"heading-usage\">Usage</h3>\n<p>K9s runs in your terminal, and if you have installed it according to the instructions for your operating system, you should be able to start it with the <code>k9s</code> command. It will by default read your current KUBECONFIG, which in turn is by default read from <code>$HOME/.kube/config.</code></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, K9s slows down considerably when processing large log amounts.

Since it's initial release in June 2014, the Kubernetes as a term, has been associated with words like k8s, k9s and very recently with k3s as well.\n\nBut before we get started and deep dive into more about - k9s & k3s, let's first get us familiarize ourselves with Kubernetes, shall we?\n\nSo, the first thing that comes in mind is ~ *What is kubernetes?*\n\n# What is Kubernetes?\n\nKubernetes is a standard container orchestration open-source platform, that is, for managing applications constructed from several, often self-contained runtimes called containers. It is a widely used tool to deploy and update the application without any downtime.\n\nIt is generally known as k8s or “kube”, where 8 in 'k8s' is a abbreviation for \"ubernete\".  \nKubernetes also handles things like upgrades of your containers, so when you make a new release of your website, it will gradually launch containers with the new version and gradually kill off the old ones, usually over a minute or two.\n\n## How it helps us?\n\nKubernetes orchestration allows you to build application services that span multiple containers, schedule those containers across a cluster, scale those containers, and manage the health of those containers over time. With Kubernetes you can take effective steps toward better IT security.\n\nKubernetes also needs to integrate with networking, storage, security, telemetry, and other services to provide a comprehensive container infrastructure.\n\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656312811622/kldSdyrjG.png align=\"left\")\n\n* Microservices in containers make it\\*\\* easier to orchestrate services\\*\\*, including storage, networking, and security. This significantly multiplies the number of containers in your environment, and as those containers accumulate, the complexity also grows.\n    \n* It fixes a lot of common problems with container proliferation by sorting containers together into \"pods.\" Pods **add a layer of abstraction** to grouped containers.\n    \n* Other parts of Kubernetes help you\\*\\* balance loads\\*\\* across these pods and ensure you have the right number of containers running to support your workloads.\n    \n\n## What is Kubernetes-Cluster?\n\nA working Kubernetes deployment is called a cluster. You can visualize a Kubernetes cluster as two parts: **Master and Node**.\n\n* **Node**: Where we run our applications\n    \n* **Master**: Used to coordinate the cluster.\n    \n\nEach node is its own Linux environment, and which could be either a physical or virtual machine and each node runs pods, which are made up of containers.\n\nMaster is responsible for managing the cluster. The master nodes will coordinate all the activities in your cluster, such as scheduling applications, maintaining their desired state, scaling applications, and rolling new updates.\n\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656313435775/s5y0nfdyo.png align=\"left\")\n\n# Starting with K9s\n\n**k9s** is a terminal-based UI for managing the Kubernetes clusters, that aims to simplify navigating, observing, and managing applications in k8s. K9s continuously monitors Kubernetes clusters for changes and provides shortcut commands to interact with the observed resources.\n\n## Installation\n\nK9s is open-source software and available for various operating systems with instructions on this official repository. If you use a package manager, K9s will be available through it.\n\n* On Mac OS, you can install K9s with brew: brew install k9s\n    \n* On Windows, either via *scoop* or *chocolatey*: scoop install k9s choco install k9s\n    \n\n### Usage\n\nK9s runs in your terminal, and if you have installed it according to the instructions for your operating system, you should be able to start it with the `k9s` command. It will by default read your current KUBECONFIG, which in turn is by default read from `$HOME/.kube/config.`\n\nUnfortunately, K9s slows down considerably when processing large log amounts. At such moments, K9s wholly used two cores of my Intel Xeon E312xx CPU and could even freeze.\n\n# Issues and Troubleshooting\n\nOne of the biggest issue is that, deployment failure messages on Kubernetes are complex and not intuitive for debugging. Users need to identify the errors from pod logs, pod events(describe pod), pod status, etc. Developers spend a lot of time and effort demystifying the cryptic messages K8s throws up, perfectly valuable time that could have otherwise gone in building core functionalities of the application.\n\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656314971586/nRKD_JTv5.png align=\"left\")\n\n## Komodor - A Trouble Shooting Platform\n\nHere **Komodor** makes things interesting by handling the k8s-native troubleshooting , so that developers can save a lot of time actually developing instead of wasting hours of their valuable time troubleshooting and focus on building interesting stuff. It tracks changes across your entire k8s stack, identifies issues, uncovers their root cause and delivers the context you need to troubleshoot efficiently and independently.\n\nKomodor supports configurations per Monitor, meaning it's monitors are being configured on a cluster level, each monitor supports the following configurations:\n\n* **Trigger conditions** - specify when this monitor should be triggered, conditions vary per monitor.\n    \n* **Scope** - which resources should be monitored, the scope can be configured for the entire cluster, specific namespaces, annotations or labels, the relationship between the selected resources is currently OR relationship.\n    \n* **Sink/Notification** - where do you want to receive notifications.\n    \n\n---\n\n# Follow up Resources\n\n* Kubernetes Basics - [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)\n    \n* K9s Commands -

Their APIs are fast, reliable, integrate onto any platform, and speak many languages. It allows you to set up authentication in less than 10 minutes.\n\n---\n\n# What is Twilio?\nTwilio is a US cloud communication platform as a service (CPaaS) company. Twilio’s programmable application program interfaces (APIs) are a set of building blocks developers can use to build the exact customer experiences they want, such as :\n\n- Making/receiving phone calls\n- Sending/receiving text messages\n- Launching email campaigns\n- Staying connected with customers\n\nBesides, Twilio also automates user verification and marketing campaign monitoring using its web service APIs and many more.\n\n---\n\n# TL;DR\n\n- [Source Code](https://github.com/Sonichigo/twilio-with-sawo)\n- [SAWO Labs](https://sawolabs.com/)\n- [Twilio](https://twilio.com/)\n\n---\n\n# Let's get started\n\nTo get started, first create a new folder for the project and make it ready by running following commands.\n\n```\nmkdir greetnmeet\ncd greetnmeet\n```\n\nNow let's setup twilio-cli in our desktop\n\n```\nnpm install -g twilio-cli\ntwilio login\n```\n\nSince, we are making video app the proper tokens with necessary permissions are required for the user to get the app working. For that we need to create a new file  ``funtions/get_token.js`` .\n\n```\nconst twilio = require('twilio');\n\nexports.handler = async function(context, event, callback) {\n  const accessToken = new twilio.jwt.AccessToken(\n    context.ACCOUNT_SID, context.API_KEY_SID, context.API_KEY_SECRET\n  );\n  accessToken.identity = event.username;\n  console.log(event);\n  const videoGrant = new twilio.jwt.AccessToken.VideoGrant({\n    room: 'roomname',\n  });\n  accessToken.addGrant(videoGrant);\n  return callback(null, {\n    token: accessToken.toJwt(),\n  });\n}\n\n``` \nNow we are ready to call this function in our frontend. So let's get ahead and file call ``assests/video.html`` to setup our video services.\n\n```\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"styles.css\">\n    <title>Greet n Meet</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div class=\"topnav\">\n      <a class=\"nav-link active\" aria-current=\"page\" href=\"#\">Home</a>\n    </div>\n\n    <h1 align=\"center\">Greet n Meet</h1> \n\n    <form align=\"center\">\n      <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\"><br/>\n      <button id=\"join_leave\">Join call</button>\n    </form>\n\n    <div id=\"container\" class=\"container\">\n      <div id=\"local\" class=\"participant\">\n        <div></div>\n        <div>You</div>\n      </div>\n      <!-- more participants will be added dynamically here -->\n    </div>\n\n    <p id=\"count\" align=\"center\"></p>\n\n    <script src=\"https://sdk.twilio.com/js/video/releases/2.20.1/twilio-video.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"app.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n``twilio-video.min.js`` is Twilio’s Programmable Video JavaScript SDK lets you add real time voice and video to your web applications. The JavaScript SDK connects to a Twilio Video Room and allows you to control the client-side video conference experience.\n\nNow it's time to make our ``video.html`` responsive, let's make an ``app.js`` which we have called above under the script folder.\n```javascript\nconst usernameInput = document.getElementById('username');\nconst roomNameInput = document.getElementById(\"roomname\");\nconst button = document.getElementById('join_leave');\nconst container = document.getElementById('container');\nconst count = document.getElementById('count');\nlet connected = false;\nlet room;\n\nconst addLocalVideo = async () => {\n  const track = await Twilio.Video.createLocalVideoTrack();\n  const video = document.getElementById('local').firstElementChild;\n  video.appendChild(track.attach());\n};\n\nconst connectButtonHandler = async (event) => {\n  event.preventDefault();\n  if (!connected) {\n    const username = usernameInput.value;\n    if (!username) {\n      alert('Enter your name before connecting');\n      return;\n    }\n    button.disabled = true;\n    button.innerHTML = 'Connecting...';\n    try {\n      await connect(username);\n      button.innerHTML = 'Leave call';\n      button.disabled = false;\n    }\n    catch {\n      alert('Connection failed. Is the backend running?');\n      button.innerHTML = 'Join call';\n      button.disabled = false;    \n    }\n  }\n  else {\n    disconnect();\n    button.innerHTML = 'Join call';\n    connected = false;\n  }\n};\n\n```\nLet's call our get_token endpoint we created earlier to grant the token to the user accessing our app, and use it to connect with other on the same stream. Also let's setup other functionality such as disconnect and participants too.\n\n```javascript\nconst connect = async (username) => {\n  const response = await fetch('/get_token', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},\n    body: JSON.stringify({'username':username}),\n  });\n\n  const data = await response.json();\n  room = await Twilio.Video.connect(data.token);\n  room.participants.forEach(participantConnected);\n  room.on('participantConnected', participantConnected);\n  room.on('participantDisconnected', participantDisconnected);\n  connected = true;\n  usernameInput.style.display = 'none';\n  updateParticipantCount();\n};\n\nconst updateParticipantCount = () => {\n  if (!connected) {\n    count.innerHTML = 'Disconnected.';\n  }\n  else {\n    count.innerHTML = (room.participants.size + 1) + ' participants online.';\n  }\n};\n\nconst participantConnected = (participant) => {\n  const participantDiv = document.createElement('div');\n  participantDiv.setAttribute('id', participant.sid);\n  participantDiv.setAttribute('class', 'participant');\n\n  const tracksDiv = document.createElement('div');\n  participantDiv.appendChild(tracksDiv);\n\n  const labelDiv = document.createElement('div');\n  labelDiv.innerHTML = participant.identity;\n  participantDiv.appendChild(labelDiv);\n\n  container.appendChild(participantDiv);\n\n  participant.tracks.forEach(publication => {\n    if (publication.isSubscribed) {\n      trackSubscribed(tracksDiv, publication.track);\n    }\n  });\n  participant.on('trackSubscribed', track => trackSubscribed(tracksDiv, track));\n  participant.on('trackUnsubscribed', trackUnsubscribed);\n  updateParticipantCount();\n};\n\nconst participantDisconnected = (participant) => {\n  document.getElementById(participant.sid).remove();\n  updateParticipantCount();\n};\n\nconst trackSubscribed = (div, track) => {\n  div.appendChild(track.attach());\n};\n\nconst trackUnsubscribed = (track) => {\n  track.detach().forEach(element => element.remove());\n};\n\nconst disconnect = () => {\n  room.disconnect();\n  while (container.lastChild.id != 'local') {\n      container.removeChild(container.lastChild);\n  }\n  button.innerHTML = 'Join call';\n  usernameInput.style.display = 'inline-block';\n  connected = false;\n  updateParticipantCount();\n};\n\naddLocalVideo();\nbutton.addEventListener('click', connectButtonHandler);\n\n```\nWe are done with setting up with our video webapp. Wait..! Something is not right. If we leave our app as it is, then anyone will be able to access it directly and might intrude in the conversation. To prevent such intrusion and also to secure our app, let's put up the SAWO authentication.\n\nFirst let's get our credentials, by signing in to [SAWO Labs Dashboard](https://dev.sawolabs.com/)\nSelect Create New project and then choose ``Web ``-> ``</>Code`` \n\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649935359498/rQrZtqrEC.png)\n\nSave your API Key and for now let's keep our hostname url as *localhost*.  Go to the form section and let's add our google spreadsheet with the email of people we want our app to used by. \n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649935569440/UezbYYM9k.png)\n\nThis SAWO feature allow us to prevent other from entering in directly and at same allows people we want to meet directly. Now it's time to setup our login in ``index.html`` in same folder as video.html.\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n    <title>Greet n Meet</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div class=\"topnav\">\n      <a class=\"nav-link active\" aria-current=\"page\" href=\"#\">Home</a>\n      <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"/radio.html\" target=\"_blank\">Radio</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <div class=\"login-container\">\n        <h1 align=\"center\">Greet n Meet</h1>\n        <div id=\"sawo-container\" style=\"height: 400px; width: 300px\" align:\"center\"></div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <script src=\"https://websdk.sawolabs.com/sawo.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n      const payload = sessionStorage.getItem(\"payload\");\n      if (payload) {\n        window.location.href = \"/video.html\";\n      }\n      var config = {\n        containerID: \"sawo-container\",\n        identifierType: \"email\",\n        apiKey: \"APIKEY\", // create in our SAWO Dashboard\n        onSuccess: (payload) => {\n          sessionStorage.setItem(\"payload\", JSON.stringify(payload));\n            window.location.href = \"/video.html\";\n        },\n      };\n      var sawo = new Sawo(config);\n      sawo.showForm();\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNow our authentication is ready, but wait even now by url bypassing anyone might enter in our stream, for that let's create a script in our ``video.html``that let's the access to the video stream by verifying the payload content.\n\n```javascript\n\n    <script>\n      const payload = sessionStorage.getItem(\"payload\");\n      if (payload) {\n        // If the payload is available then console.log the payload\n        console.log(\"Payload : \" + payload);\n      } else {\n        // If the payload isn't available, that means the user hasn't logged in yet.\n        // So redirecting back to authentication\n        window.location.href = \"/index.html\";\n      }\n    </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nFinally our app is completed and ready to deploy on twilio' severless platform\n```\ntwilio plugins:install @twilio-labs/plugin-serverless\n\ntwilio serverless:deploy\n```\n\n---\n# Follow up resources\n\n- [Twilio Serverless](https://www.twilio.com/docs/labs/serverless-toolkit/examples)\n- [SAWO

However, many workflows are filled with manual tasks that are time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. This is where Workflow Automation comes in, it refers to the design, execution, and automation of processes based on workflow rules where human tasks, data or files are routed between systems based on pre-defined business rules.\n\nIn short, it is an approach to making the flow of tasks, documents and information across work-related activities easy.\n\n\n### Why Workflow Automation Is Used?\n\nBy automating workflows, especially those processes that are primarily handled manually by employees, significant improvements can be made in:\n\n1. Reduces Human Error\n2. Improves Operational Efficiency\n3. Increases Workplace Accountability\n\n\n### What is CI/CD?\n\nCI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.\n\n\n#### CI vs CD vs (and the other CD)\n\n1. Continuous integration:-\n\n   Continuous integration puts a great emphasis on testing automation to check that the application is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch.\n\n2. Continuous delivery:- \n\n     Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. \nThis means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button.\n\n3. Continuous deployment:-\n\n     It goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.\n\n\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648541123679/XzBz7ilqX.png)\n\n\n## What are some common CI/CD tools?\n\n1. [MSPowerAutomate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-us/) cloud-based system to create automated workflows. \n\n2. [Github Action's](https://github.com/features/actions) automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows.\n\n3. [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/) CI/CD is a tool for software development using continuous methods.\n\n4. [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery platform that can be used to implement DevOps practices.\n\n5. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) workflows for modern applications, integrates with GitHub and Bitbucket, and with your favorite tools with API-based automated

During the process, I found that there was a need to know more than what the official documentation provided. \nHere then is a small walkthrough to help you integrate SAWO Labs authentication with a Basic React applications.\n\n#### Baisc Features of the WEB APP\n- A Login Page\n- A User Dashboard\n\n#### Let’s get started\n1. You need a SAWO Labs account in order to use this awesome stuff. Head over to  [sawolabs.com](https://sawolabs.com)  and create your first project, select the platform and set the Host to localhost, if you chose to develop locally. Otherwise, you can set Host as your application URL.\n\n- **We will be choosing web as our platform!**\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632537516009/Ugmb-yyzC.png)\n\n\n2. Open the VScode and run ``npx create-react-app Project`` to create the react app default structure.\n\n3. We need to have the SAWO labs package in our *node_modules*. So head over to the terminal, make sure, you have entered  \n       cd Project\nand run the following command to install the SAWO package: - \n       npm i sawo \n\n4. After the package is installed, head to ``src/app.js`` and import the SAWO package:- \n\n```\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport \"./App.css\";\nimport Sawo from \"sawo\";\nfunction App() {\n\nlet [payload, setPayload] = React.useState(false);\n\nReact.useEffect(() => {\n  var config = {\n      containerID: \"sawo-container\",\n      identifierType: \"email\",\n      apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_API_SAWO,\n      onSuccess: (payload) => {\n        // console.log(payload); \n        setPayload(payload)\n      },\n    };\n    let sawo = new Sawo(config);\n    sawo.showForm();\n }, []); \n\n   return (\n         <div\n          id=\"sawo-container\"\n          style={{ height: \"300px\", width: \"300px\" }}\n        ></div>\n  );\n}\nexport default App;\n```\nalso for the SAWO API to work you need the API key, which we get from the project console:-\n\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632538176891/bJ5CZr7Rq.png)\n\nSave your API Key in the .env file and make sure you have added it before itself in .gitignore. The .env file should look like this: -\n      ```React_SAWO_API : Sample_API_KEY1223456```\n\n\n### Making Dashboard\n\n1. We are going to create a file ``src/Dashboard.js``, which looks like this: -\n```\nimport React from \"react\";\nconst Dashboard = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <>\n       <h2>Private Dashboard</h2>\n        Email: {props.payload.identifier}\n    </>\n  );\n};\nexport default Dashboard;\n```\n*Note: As our method of Authentication is email,  props.payload.identifier will return EMAIL-ID of the user.\n\n2. Now we need to add the dashboard component to our app.js\n\n```\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport logo from \"./logo.svg\";\nimport \"./App.css\";\n\n//Dashboard Component\n\nimport Dashboard from './dashboard'\nimport Sawo from \"sawo\";\nfunction App() { \n\nlet [payload, setPayload] = React.useState(false);\n\nReact.useEffect(() => {\n  var config = {\n      containerID: \"sawo-container\",\n      identifierType: \"email\",\n      apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_API_SAWO,\n      onSuccess: (payload) => {\n        // console.log(payload); \n        setPayload(payload)\n      },\n    };\n    let sawo = new Sawo(config);\n    sawo.showForm();\n }, []); \n return (<>\n         <div\n          id=\"sawo-container\"\n          style={{ height: \"300px\", width: \"300px\" }}\n        ></div>\n        {payload && (\n        <>\n          <Dashboard payload={payload} />\n        </>\n        )}\n</>\n  );\n}\nexport default App;\n```\n\nAnd that’s it.

We are authorized as a user to test for bugs in a website or network and report it to them. White hat hackers generally get all the needed information about the application or network to test for, from the organization itself. They use their skills to test it before the website goes live or attacked by malicious hackers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><b>Black Hat Hackers:</b>\nHere, the organization doesn’t allow the user to test it. They unethically enter inside the website and steal data from the admin panel or manipulate the data. They only focus on themselves and the advantages they will get from the personal data for personal financial gain. They can cause major damage to the company by altering the functions which lead to the loss of the company at a much higher extent. This can even lead you to extreme consequences.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><b>Grey Hat Hackers:</b>\nThey sometimes access to the data and violates the law. But never have the same intention as Black hat hackers, they often operate for the common good. The main difference is that they exploit vulnerability publicly whereas white hat hackers do it privately for the company.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/blog/\">Read</a> about the Kali releases and it's features.

Hacking is illegal and can lead to extreme consequences if you are caught in the act. People have been sentenced to years of imprisonment because of hacking.\n\n<img src=\"https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ethical-Hacking-What-is-Ethical-Hacking-Edureka-768x304.png\">\n\n#### These are various types of hackers:\n\n```\n1. White Hat Hackers (Cyber-Security Hacker)           \n2. Black Hat Hackers (Cracker)                         \n3. Gray Hat Hackers (Both) \n```\n\nLet’s summarize them one-by-one.\n\n1. <b>White Hat Hackers:</b>\nHere, we look for bugs and ethically report it to the organization. We are authorized as a user to test for bugs in a website or network and report it to them. White hat hackers generally get all the needed information about the application or network to test for, from the organization itself. They use their skills to test it before the website goes live or attacked by malicious hackers.\n\n2. <b>Black Hat Hackers:</b>\nHere, the organization doesn’t allow the user to test it. They unethically enter inside the website and steal data from the admin panel or manipulate the data. They only focus on themselves and the advantages they will get from the personal data for personal financial gain. They can cause major damage to the company by altering the functions which lead to the loss of the company at a much higher extent. This can even lead you to extreme consequences.\n\n3. <b>Grey Hat Hackers:</b>\nThey sometimes access to the data and violates the law. But never have the same intention as Black hat hackers, they often operate for the common good. The main difference is that they exploit vulnerability publicly whereas white hat hackers do it privately for the company.\n\n## Resources\n\n1.

Well, the First digit is assigned to the Owner, the Second digit is assigned to the Group and the Third digit is assigned to the Others. \n**So for a file with ‘777’ permission, everyone can read, write and execute the file.**\n\n\n## Day 1b [Types of Hackers | Networking]\n\n1.
